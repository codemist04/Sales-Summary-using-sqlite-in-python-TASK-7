# 📊 Sales Summary Analysis

## 📌  Overview
This project demonstrates how to **create a sales database**, run **SQL queries inside Python**, and generate **clear visual summaries** of sales performance using:

- **SQLite** (lightweight database, built into Python)
- **Pandas** (data analysis & formatting)
- **Matplotlib** (data visualization)
- **Google Colab** (for execution)

The workflow includes:
1. Creating a database (`sales_data.db`) with professional product sales data.
2. Querying the database to find **total quantity sold** and **total revenue** per product.
3. Displaying results as **formatted tables** and **bar charts**.
4. Saving all outputs for easy sharing.
